# Algorithms
# solving computational problems
# Communicate to others:
# Prove correctly
# Produce efficient solutions

#
# Problems comes with an input and an output 
# A robust algorithm can produce the correct output with an arbitrary sized input

# The birthday problem: How to find if someone has the same birthday in a room
# Algorithm 1:
# - Maintain record 
# - Interview student in some order 
# - Check if birthday in record 
# - if it is, return a pair
